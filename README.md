# Rudimentary WebGL Particle System

This is a basic particle system I've thrown together.  I'm probably going to spend more time working on it, but I have put it on github so that I can look back and reference it when working on projects where I'm using particle systems.  It is pretty simplistic as particle systems go.  For the moment this is what I need.  I plan on using this repo to test out particle system ideas as I'm making effects.
